The goal of a Decision Tree algorithm is to minimize impurity when splitting nodes, aiming to create child nodes that are as 'pure' as possible (i.e., containing samples mostly belonging to one class).\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Gini Impurity\n",
        "*   **Definition**: Gini Impurity measures the probability of incorrectly classifying a randomly chosen element in the dataset if it were randomly labeled according to the distribution of labels in the subset. It ranges from 0 (pure, all elements belong to the same class) to 0.5 (maximum impurity for a binary classification).\n",

A lower Gini Impurity indicates a more homogenous set of samples in the node.\n",

It then selects the split that yields the *highest Information Gain*. This means the chosen feature is the one that best separates the data into more homogeneous classes.\n",

        "2.  **Customer Churn Prediction**: Determining which customers are likely to discontinue a service, allowing businesses to implement retention strategies.\n",

        "2.  **Handles Both Numerical and Categorical Data**: Decision Trees can process both continuous and discrete data types without extensive preprocessing like one-hot encoding for categorical features.\n",

        "### Main Limitations:\n",
        "1.  **Prone to Overfitting**: Decision Trees can easily overfit the training data, especially when they are grown to their full depth. This leads to poor generalization on unseen data.\n",
        "2.  **Instability (High Variance)**: Small variations in the training data can lead to significantly different tree structures, making them unstable. This is why ensemble methods like Random Forests or Gradient Boosting are often preferred.\n",
        "3.  **Bias towards Dominant Classes**: When the dataset has imbalanced classes, Decision Trees can be biased towards the majority classes, leading to poor performance on minority classes.\n",
